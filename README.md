# Used-Car-Pricing-Prediction-Linear-Regression
Given a dataset of 7000 used car sales data. Perform EDA and build a linear regression machine learning model to determine if this data can be used to make accurate predictions for used car prices. This data will be used by used car sellers to more accurately price their products in the marketplace.

Problem Overview:
Used car sales have recently surpassed New car sales
Unlike new cars, it is fairly difficult to determine price and supply
On new cars supply and demand are fairly predictable and prices are set by manufacturers
Used vehicles price is highly uncertain, and may have several contributing factors
Buyers and sellers require a more deterministic pricing approach for used cars that will assist in determining fair market value

Solution Approach:

The dataset provides datapoints for over 7000 used vehicles sold in the Indian market
Most importantly, the dataset provides the price for most of the vehicles (this will be the dependent variable of our model)
We will build a Machine Learning model which will ideally identify factors from our dataset which will help us determine market value for used cars in the future so that Cars4U can consistently sell cars at or above market value
